\vspace{8pt}

{\sl Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho Falls, ID} \\[2pt]
Integrated Energy Systems (IES) \hfill    2017 - Present
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item \emph{PI and lead developer, HERON (github.com/idaholab/HERON)} \\
  Led a small team of developers in implementing HERON, a Python-based object-oriented plugin of RAVEN
  for stochastic techno-economic optimization of grid-energy systems. Planned, designed, and deployed
  software under continuous-deployment version control and software quality assurance. Provided training
  and deployed plugin for analyses of novel integrated energy system technologies in several markets,
   with partner industries, other national laboratories, and universities.
  \item \emph{2021 LDRD awarded: Signal processing for cybersecurity} \\
  Managed a 3-year \$1.5M project including lab and university researchers to explore using high/low
  order correlation for false data injection detection in physical process signals, including
  toolset software development and demonstration on experimental systems.
  \item \emph{Stochastic gradient descent optimization R\&D} \\
  Extended RAVEN software to perform system optimization using stochastic gradient descent algorithms,
  including forward and central differencing as well as Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation
  (SPSA) gradient descent. Extended existing algorithms to solve stochastic system optimization problems.
  \item \emph{Point of contact for multiple awarded university-led (NEUP) proposals}
\end{itemize} \vspace{-6pt}

Uncertainty Quantification \hfill    2014 - 2017
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
  \item \emph{Sparse grid collocation for generalized polynomial chaos} \\
  As part of doctorate work, extended RAVEN sampling and reduced-order model methods to include
  sparse grid collocation sampling for multidimensional polynomial surrogate models. Demonstrated
  strengths and weaknesses of algorithm on several analytic as well as real-world problems.
  \item \emph{High-dimension model reduction} \\
  Implemented HDMR to accelerate polynomial fitting using sparse grid collocation, including both
  static and adaptive sampling strategies.
  \item \emph{Agile development, maintenance, refactoring, quality assurance}
  \item \emph{Continuous integration deployment}
  \item \emph{Senior developer, RAVEN (github.com/idaholab/raven)} \\
  Trained new users and developers in RAVEN as well as orchestrated signifcant new development and reworks
  of several systems in RAVEN as needs adjusted, managing performance in both memory and speed.
  Responded frequently to user queries, offering guidance or implementing code changes. Reviewed
  proposed code changes for software quality assurance, iterating with developers to improve code
  contributions.
