 - replace int_Omega everywhere with intom, intomn, or intomx
 - spell check everywhere
 - http://grad.unm.edu/degree-completion/thesis-dissertations/guidelines.html <- UNM thesis guidelines
 - check references for consistency with author names
 - normalize derivative dxdy to \ dx\ dy
 - cite papers I published while doing this work??
 - make sure I say "std dev" and not variance when it applies
 - Check figures for bad MC error bars
   - Also check SCgPC Results eq. 2 MC error for error in variance
      should be SE_sigma = sigma/sqrt(2*(N-1))
 - Swap double citations [1][2] to commas [1,2]

 - MC matching for pincell model.  Need Falcon for this.
