 - replace int_Omega everywhere with intom, intomn, or intomx
 - spell check everywhere
 - check references for ?? and consistency
 - normalize derivative dxdy to \ dx\ dy
 - cite papers I published while doing this work??
 - make sure I say "std dev" and not variance when it applies
 - make sure I mention Monte Carlo bands are 1 std dev somewhere
 - RAVEN flowcharts and stuff in introduction



 - REDO cases:
  - Collect nohdmr plots
  - Add sobol1, 2, and 3 series
    - merge run.py, comment out cases, then run the sobol ones (done for all cases, need running)

Done:
  Tensor Mono 3, 5, 10
  Sudret 3, 5
